Of course! A great README is essential for any project. It acts as the front page, explaining what your project does and how to use it.

Based on the files and features of your Class Performance Tracking System, here is a comprehensive and professional README file. Just copy the text below and save it as README.md in the main folder of your project.

1.About The Project
This project is a dedicated tool for educators to efficiently track and manage student performance. It provides a clean, intuitive web interface to handle two core aspects of classroom management: Attendance and Homework. The system is built on a lightweight Python Flask backend with a dynamic vanilla JavaScript frontend, making it fast, reliable, and easy to maintain.

The database is automatically initialized on the first run with predefined subjects and a student roster, making setup a breeze.

2.Key Features
📊 Attendance Management
Store Attendance: Easily mark students as 'Present', 'Absent Informed', or 'Absent Uninformed' for any subject on any given day.

Edit Existing Records: The system intelligently detects if attendance has already been taken for a specific day and allows for easy editing.

Class-wide Reports: View attendance records for an entire class, with powerful filters for a specific day, month, or year.

Individual Student Reports: Search for a specific student by name or roll number to generate a detailed attendance report across all subjects and timeframes.

📝 Homework Hub
Post & Manage Assignments: Teachers can create, edit, and delete homework assignments, specifying the title, description, subject, and due date.

Intuitive Gradebook: A redesigned gradebook lists all assignments vertically. Each assignment can be expanded to reveal a focused grading interface for all students.

Student Status Tracker: A dedicated page for a student to view all their assignments and mark them as 'Completed'. (Simulated for a single student).

Assignment Calendar: A beautiful calendar view (powered by FullCalendar) displays all homework assignments by their due dates.

Q&A Doubts Section: Each assignment has its own dedicated page where students can post doubts and teachers can post answers.

Exercism Tracker: A simple page to link to and track students' public profiles on Exercism.org.
